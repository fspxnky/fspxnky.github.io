The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the only flag. DC-9 is a VirtualBox VM built, but I host it on Proxmox Server. To get the VM image, click here.
Thanks to @DCAU7 and the team for creating this machine.
The machine IP address is 192.168.50.108 for me, yours will be different.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Vuln Lab in Proxmox</title><link>https://fspxnky.github.io/settingupvulnlab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 22:11:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fspxnky.github.io/settingupvulnlab/</guid><description>The machine i downloaded and install are from NetSecFocus Trophy Room, under the vulnhub section. I will install the machine highligted in the red section into my proxmox.
I only manage to install 32 machines out of 38 into the proxmox.
6 Machines that i didn&amp;rsquo;t installed due to:
Healthcare - (Too old for it to work, maybe?) Photography - (File too big for unknown reason : 500GB) GlasgowSmile - (Cannot boot, lead to grub rescue) Breach 3 - (Got IP in Proxmox but appear offline) LordoftheRoot - (Got IP in Proxmox but appear offline) Alpha 1 - (Link Broken) Download Vulnerable Machine from Vulnhub First, lets download 1 machine from vulnhub.</description></item></channel></rss>
