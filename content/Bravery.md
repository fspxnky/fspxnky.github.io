This machine hopes to inspire BRAVERY in you; this machine may surprise you from the outside. This is designed for OSCP practise, and the original version of the machine was used for a CTF. It is now revived, and made more nefarious than the original. BRAVERY is a VirtualBox VM built, but I host it on Proxmox Server. To get the VM image, click [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/digitalworldlocal-bravery,281/).

> The machine IP address is `192.168.50.109` for me, yours will be different. Do scan your network before proceeding with the attack. Do snapshot the machine before proceeding, in case we need to revert it once we are finish or we mess up the machine.
